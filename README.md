# GitHub Profile README Templates

A collection of creative and well-designed GitHub profile README templates 
to help you stand out as a developer.

This repository was created to help others personalize their GitHub 
profiles easily.  
Browse the templates and copy the one that fits your style — then make it 
your own!

## Templates

All templates are located in the [`templates/`](./templates) folder.  
Each one is a ready-to-use `README.md` file that you can copy and 
customize.

## How to use

1. Open the [`templates/`](./templates) folder.
2. Pick a template you like.
3. Copy the content into your own GitHub profile README:
   - Create a new repository named **`<your-github-username>`** (exactly 
that).
   - Add a `README.md` file with the content of your chosen template.
4. Customize it with your name, bio, skills, and anything else you want!
